<!-- Congratulation to Guanghui and thank the LLVM Foundation for his support. -->

<!-- PhD candidate Guanghui Song from our laboratory moderated Session 6: Student & Technical Talks at EuroLLVM 2025 in Berlin, supported by the LLVM Foundation Travel Grant. The session featured cutting-edge research in LLVM-based compiler technologies, including student presentations on multithreaded code analysis (Isaac Nudelman), HPC tool integration (Sebastian Kreutzer), and automated backend generation (Kevin Per). A technical talk by Yashwant Singh on *Ilvmlite: A Python Gym for LLVM concluded the session. As moderator, Guanghui ensured strict adherence to the schedule, facilitated Q&A, and coordinated transitions between talks. His role highlights our labâ€™s active engagement in open-source compiler innovation and global academic collaboration.   -->
