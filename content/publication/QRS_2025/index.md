abstract: "Floating-point error detection is crucial in numerical computing, particularly for multi-parameter functions where even minor errors can propagate and significantly impact results. The sparse distribution of floating-point errors poses a significant detection challenge, as significant deviations are triggered by only rare inputs. Existing search algorithms face two major limitations: poor scalability for multi-parameter functions and insufficient utilization of floating-point representation characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose SDPS (Scalable Detection via Parallel Subdomain Search), a novel algorithm that combines adaptive domain partitioning with floating-point-specific heuristics. SDPS employs a multi-level error classification system and specialized point generation strategies, supported by efficient parallel processing through dynamic task allocation. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that SDPS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both detection accuracy and computational efficiency, especially for multi-parameter functions where it effectively addresses the exponential growth of search space that limits existing approaches."
